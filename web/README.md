## Deployment

When deploying this application, you can either install it on an existing reverse proxy or use the provided Dockerfile
to host a basic server for testing.

### With Docker

This guide assumes you've already deployed the backend image, and are using an overlay network called `hpas`. Adjust as
necessary for your setup.

1. Build the image: `docker build . --tag hpas_frontend:latest`
2. Deploy the image: `docker run -d --name hpas_frontend --network hpas -p 80:80/tcp hpas_frontend:latest`
    - This assumes there's no other web server on the Docker host. If this isn't the case, try the without Docker
      deployment option below.

### Without Docker

This guide will show how to add a new virtual server to an existing Nginx server. The same rough steps should apply to
any reverse proxy + web server.

1. Install NodeJS 9.0 or higher along with the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com).
    - üç∫ If you're on a macOS machine, you can use Homebrew to fetch both: `brew install node yarn`
2. Build the project: `yarn run build`
3. Copy the contents of `dist` to your web server (this example will use `/opt/hpas/web`, change as needed)
4. Configure Nginx (or your proxy/web server of choice) to serve the assets and redirect API requests.
    - Change the `proxy_pass` URL to wherever you have the backend deployed. If deploying on the same host (recommended)
      use `localhost` with the appropriate port that was exposed from the backend container.
    - Set other configuration as needed. An SSL configuration is highly recommended, as is setting `server_name` if the
      server hosts multiple domain names. If using SSL, add a redirect to HTTPS for HTTP connections!
    - If you're not using Nginx, you'll need to translate this to your proxy/web server of choice.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;

  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://hpas_backend:8080;
    proxy_pass_header Server;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }

  location / {
    root /opt/hpas/web;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
}
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8888
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
